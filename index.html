                <p>This project was to learn about optimisation and task control in a more structured manner than in the Populus remake, each agent having 6 individual needs with modifiers to them such as social obligation and morality. Its a framework that allowed on fairly low end hardware to simulate up to 600 agents going about their days in the simulated town.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>This project was to try and create a tool to check if levels are completable by using Unity's built-in navmesh, with focus being on making the tool easy to use. By adding the checker into the scene and having a navmesh it makes sure that all areas marked with a checkpoint are reachable and that the end is reachable. It does this via visual indicators such as turning the most efficient movement path from green to red if a point is unreachable and making a very obvious beacon or red and white on that checkpoint.  </p>

                <p>This was a group effort to recreate the game Populus in DirectX in a week, i was tasked with creating the backend to allow for control rebinding as our target platform was an arcade cabinet, although difficult to see in the demonstration video each pop, or human, will create housing on level ground and will create new pops.</p>
